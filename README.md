# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used contains 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species.

## Features of the Dataset
- `sepal_length`: Length of the sepal in cm.
- `sepal_width`: Width of the sepal in cm.
- `petal_length`: Length of the petal in cm.
- `petal_width`: Width of the petal in cm.
- `species`: Species of the Iris flower. This is the target variable.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Keras
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn keras scikit-learn
